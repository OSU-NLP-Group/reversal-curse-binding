Let\u0027s assume Rochelle\u0027s number \u003d 359.\n\nThen, Lewis\u0027s number \u003d Rochelle\u0027s number + 44 \u003d 359 + 44 \u003d 403.\nMaira\u0027s number \u003d 19 + Lewis\u0027s number \u003d 19 + 403 \u003d 422.\n\nLet\u0027s verify with other equations involving Maira\u0027s number, Inge\u0027s number, Lewis\u0027s number, Della\u0027s number, Hilaria\u0027s number, Rochelle\u0027s number, Lizabeth\u0027s number.\nInge\u0027s number + Lewis\u0027s number \u003d Maira\u0027s number. 19 + 403 \u003d 422. Correct.\nRochelle\u0027s number + Della\u0027s number \u003d Lewis\u0027s number. 359 + 44 \u003d 403. Correct.\nLizabeth\u0027s number + Hilaria\u0027s number \u003d Lewis\u0027s number. 359 + 44 \u003d 403. Correct.\n\nFinal Answer: 422",
